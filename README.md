The EDI Reader is a free website which aims to facilitate the reading EDI files to the maritime industry, for this, having the file, you must load it on our site that it will be interpreted and displayed on the screen or save as xls file. It is important to explain that we have not copied any information the file read.  We are making available a test version for EDI Reader only for standard COARRI, CODECO and BAPLIE.

I did this because I was needing to see the data of this files and I would not want to find this in Notepad. So I did this web site.

In the first part wrote the "Show on Screen".

Some months I was needing to have this on a XLS and then, I wrote the "Save as XLS"
